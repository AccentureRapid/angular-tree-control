## Why yet another tree control

We have tried a number of tree controls built for angular and experience a of issues with each. As a result we decided
to build a new tree control with the following design guidelines

- isolated scope - the tree control should not pollute the scope it is rendered at
- do not change the tree data - some tree implementations mark on the tree data the selection and expansion of nodes
- allow customization of the tree node label using the angular way - as an angular template
- support large trees with minimal overhead
- react to changes in the tree data, updating the tree as required
- support css styling - we provide three built in styles and allowing to add more

## Installation

Copy the script and css into your project and add a script and link tag to your page.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="/tree-control.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/tree-control.css">
```

Add a dependency to your application module.

```javascript
angular.module('myApp', ['treeControl']);
```

Add tree elements to your Angular template

```html
<treecontrol class="tree-classic"
   tree-model="dataForTheTree"
   node-children="children"
   on-selection="showSelected(node)"
   selected-node="node1">
   employee: {{node.name}} age {{node.age}}
</treecontrol>
```

and add the data for the tree

```javascript
$scope.dataForTheTree =
[
	{ "name" : "Joe", "age" : "21", "children" : [
		{ "name" : "Smith", "age" : "42", "children" : [] },
		{ "name" : "Gary", "age" : "21", "children" : [
			{ "name" : "Jenifer", "age" : "23", "children" : [
				{ "name" : "Dani", "age" : "32", "children" : [] },
				{ "name" : "Max", "age" : "34", "children" : [] }
			]}
		]}
	]},
	{ "name" : "Albert", "age" : "33", "children" : [] },
	{ "name" : "Ron", "age" : "29", "children" : [] }
];
```
